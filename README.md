[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/dnxhxa3chg1dtpnt/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/sharwell/justmycodetoggle/branch/master)

This extension adds the **Debug.JustMyCodeToggle** command to Visual Studio. By default, the command appears in the **Debug** toolbar as well as in the context menu for the **Call Stack** window.

### Debug Toolbar

### Keyboard

By default, the new command is not bound to a keystroke. A key binding may be added manually by configuring a binding for the **Debug.JustMyCodeToggle** command.
